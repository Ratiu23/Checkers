## Developer notes

- played by two players
- each player starts with 12 checkers
- only the dark squares are used
- black goes first
- pieces are limited to diagonal forward moves only
- capture a piece by leaping over your opponent's piece landing on an empty square
- win the game by blocking all your opponent's pieces or capture them all
- have fun!
