                        Sacrifice 1 piece for 2: you can sometimes bait or force the opponent to take one of your pieces enabling you to then take 2 of their pieces.<br><br>
                        Pieces on the sides are valuable because they can't be jumped.<br><br>
                        Don't bunch all your pieces in the middle or you may not be able to move, and then you will lose.<br><br>
                        Try to keep your pieces on the back row or king row for as long as possible, to keep the other player from gaining a king.<br>
